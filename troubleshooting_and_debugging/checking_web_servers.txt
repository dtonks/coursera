How to check why web servers are slow using the terminal:

# Below asks to make 500 requests
# You can see how fast it is reading the requests
ab -n 500 site.example.com/

# If the website is slow, log into the website
# Looks like ffmpeg is slowing everything down
ssh webserver

# Check the highest CPU usage
top

# Exit top
q

# Use nice to start a process with a different priority
nice

# Use renice for changing the priority of a process that's already running
# renice takes the new priority as the first arguement and the process ID to change, as the second
renice

# Use Pidof, receives the process name and returns all process IDs that have that name
# Iterate over the output of pidof with for loop
# call renice for each of the process IDs
for pid in $(pidof ffmpeg); do renice 19 $pid; done

# rerun benchmark test
ab -n 500 site.example.com/

ps ax | less
/ffmpeg
q

locate static/001.webm

#go to the directory
cd ...

grep ffmpeg *

# This is the example script
vim deploy_videos

# remove the part of the script that is causing it to be slow

# Now that the error is removed, we can stop all processes for ffmpeg
killall -STOP ffmpeg

# for loop so you dont have to do one by one
for pld in $(pidof ffmpeg); do while kill -CONT $pid; do sleep 1; done; done
